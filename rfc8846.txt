1.  Introduction

   The R-Type project is a third year project from Epitech.

   The R-Type project goal is to create an online multiplayer copy of the
   original R-Type game from 1987.

   This memo is the official specification of the R-Type project
   protocols.

2.  R-Type Architecture

   The architecture used by the R-Type project is a classic client-server
   game architecture.

   The logic and math of the game is handled by the server only.

   A client connects to the server by using the R-Type Network Protocol.
   Once connected, the server creates a lobby and starts a countdown of
   15 seconds before starting the game.
   Multiple clients can connect to the same server at the same time.
   After the countdown ends, all the clients connected will begin a new
   game.

3.  R-Type Network Protocol

   All client-server communication, before and during the game, is 
   handled using this protocol.

   3a.  Message Types

      A message transmitted between the client and the server MUST have a
      header containing the Message Type of this type:

         CustomMsgType ID;
         uint32_t SIZE;
         std::vector<uint8_t> BODY;


      Where ID is a element of the CustomMsgType enum class 
      (described below) representing the action and if applicable, the
      type of data sent, along with a BODY containing the data in 
      SIZE bytes.

      The CustomMsgType enum class:

         enum class CustomMsgTypes : uint32_t {
            ServerAccept,
            ServerDeny,
            ServerPing,
            MessageAll,
            ServerMessage,
            SendData,
            SendEnnemies,
            SendBullets,
            SendBonus,
            AcceptedPlayer,
            AssignPlayerID,
            PlayerRegisterWithServer,
            PlayerUnregisterWithServer,
            AddPlayer,
            RemovePlayer,
            UpdatePlayer,
            PlayerIsShooting,
            PlayerUpdate,
         };

      To send a message, you MUST set the ID of the message to a
      valid type. All SIZE calculation is handled automatically and
      therefore should NOT be set manually by overriding the message.

      To received a message, you MUST read the ID in the header to know
      the type of BODY to expect, then you MUST read the SIZE to know the
      size of the BODY.

      There is no limit to the size of the message.

   3b.  Server/Client sync

      The client and the server synchronize themselves using the message
      type UpdatePlayer, SendData, SendEnnemies, SendBullets and
      MessageAll.
